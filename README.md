# girocode-scanner-osx

An extension app written in Swift for [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com/app) that is able to scan [Girocodes](https://www.girocode.de) 
using the primary webcam. The invoice data is sent via AppleScript to MoneyMoney. 
Saves some typing for invoices that have a girocode printed onto.
